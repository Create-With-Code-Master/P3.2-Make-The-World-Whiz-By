outcome: The background moves seamlessly at the same time as the obstacles, and the obstacles will despawn when they exit game boundaries. With the power of script communication, the background and spawn manager will halt when the player collides with an obstacle. Colliding with an obstacle will also trigger a game over message in the console log, halting the background and the spawn manager.
